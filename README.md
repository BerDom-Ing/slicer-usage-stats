## History

The idea of collecting and organizing usage statistics for the 3D Slicer
application and its extensions began in July 2023. Discussions and approaches
have been openly documented on the Slicer forum. For more details, you can read
the forum post titled
[Should we start collecting software usage data?](https://discourse.slicer.org/t/should-we-start-collecting-software-usage-data/30873).
